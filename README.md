# grocery_store_price_comparer

The goal is to create a webpage that can get prices of the same product accross multiple grocery stores. For the MVP, stores/websites and products will have to be added manually. It's possible that this could be automated in the future if I have time, but I wouldn't count on it.

Ideas:
- accounts to separate users
- database for products shared across users
- form to submit requests to add a new store
- best price highlighted in green
- option to add discounts a user receives at a store (e.g. employee discount, rewards card discount, etc.)
- let people submit PRs to add their own stores
- - provide instructions on how to do this, i.e. Selenium IDE, looking at example code
